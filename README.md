# 📚 Library Management System

A full-stack multitenant library management application built with **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)** for Java, designed for deployment on **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)**.

## 🎯 Overview

This application provides comprehensive library management capabilities with support for books, members, and loan tracking. It includes automatic fine calculation, email validation, duplicate prevention, and is designed for SaaS multitenancy deployment.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **📖 Book Management**: Create, read, update, and delete books with automatic stock tracking

### Configuring Users (Production)

1. Go to BTP Cockpit
2. Navigate to your subaccount → Security → Role Collections
3. Assign users to role collections

## 🧪 Sample Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding Books and Members

```bash
# Add a book
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/odata/v4/LibraryService/Books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
    "author": "David Thomas",
    "stock": 3
  }'

# Register a member
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/odata/v4/LibraryService/Members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
  }'
```

### Scenario 2: Creating a Loan

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/odata/v4/LibraryService/Loans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookId": "<book-id>",
    "memberId": "<member-id>",
    "loanDate": "2026-01-11",
    "dueDate": "2026-02-10"
  }'
```

### Scenario 3: Returning a Book (On Time)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/odata/v4/LibraryService/returnBook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "loanId": "<loan-id>",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
  }'

# Response: { "value": 0 }  // No fine
```

### Scenario 4: Returning a Book (Overdue)

If the book is returned 5 days late:

```bash
# Response: { "value": 50 }  // ₹10 × 5 days = ₹50
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### application.yaml

Key configurations:

```yaml
cds:
  multitenancy:
    enabled: true          # Enable multitenancy
    tenantId: request      # Extract tenant from request
  
  security:
    authentication-strategy: never  # Disable auth for subscription endpoints
```

### xs-security.json

Defines OAuth2 security:
- Scopes: `Admin`, `Callback`, `mtcallback`
- Role templates
- Grant authorities for SaaS Registry

### mta.yaml

Multi-Target Application descriptor:
- Defines modules (db, srv, approuter)
- Configures services (HANA, XSUAA, SaaS Registry)
- Sets up routes and dependencies

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Trial Account Limitations

**What Works:**
- ✅ All CRUD operations
- ✅ Business logic (loans, returns, fines)
- ✅ Subscription API endpoints (return HTTP 200)
- ✅ Single-tenant deployment

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Multitenancy with tenant-specific HDI containers
- ❌ Tenant database isolation
- ❌ Full SaaS subscription flow

**Why:** Trial accounts don't have access to HANA Cloud's HDI container provisioning for tenants.

**Solution:** For production multitenancy, deploy to a production BTP account with HANA Cloud service.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Maven build fails:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd srv
mvn clean install -U
```

**MTA build fails:**
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
rm -rf mta_archives/ node_modules/ srv/target/
npm install
mbt build
```

### Deployment Issues

**Service creation fails:**
```bash
# Check service status
cf services

# View service creation logs
cf service library-db
```

**Application won't start:**
```bash
# View application logs
cf logs library-management-srv --recent

# Check application details
cf app library-management-srv
```

### Runtime Issues

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify HANA service is running
- Check service binding: `cf env library-management-srv`

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify XSUAA service configuration
- Check xs-security.json is correctly deployed

## 🧹 Maintenance

### Update Dependencies

```bash
# Update Node.js dependencies
npm update

# Update Maven dependencies
cd srv
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

### Clean Build Artifacts

```bash
# Remove all build artifacts
rm -rf mta_archives/ node_modules/ srv/target/ db/gen/

# Reinstall and rebuild
npm install
mbt build
```

### Redeploy

```bash
# Rebuild and redeploy
mbt build
cf deploy mta_archives/library-management_1.0.0.mtar
```
